# paradox-configs
The list of all the configurations I have.

## Usage
I have used [stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/manual/stow.html) for managing the configurations seamlessly.
Stow creates symlinks to configurations from an arbitary locations stored as needed.
```bash
sudo apt install stow
```

```bash
sudo pacman -S stow
```

### Using Stow
Clone the repo and stow every directory in it. Eg:  
```bash
stow nvim
```
Creates symlinks for nvim configurations.
